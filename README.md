- 💫 Hi, we're **Cunning Folk Media**, purveyors of magical books, enchanted products, and mystical services for seekers and practitioners on all paths. You can find out more about us on [**our company website**](http://cunningfolk.media). To keep our business tidy, we recently spun off a company called [**Cunning Folk Technology**](https://cunningfolk.tech), focused on software development (_mobile and web apps_), real-world AI and ML solutions, virtual workforce creation & management (Autonomous AI Agents), and automation of business processes and functions that traditionally required entire departments staffed by teams of human workers.
- ❤️‍🔥 We're interested in **software development**, **Generative A.I.**, and [**Magick**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_%28supernatural%29?wprov=sfla1). 🧙🏻‍♂️✨
- 📚 We're currently neck-deep in code for a _super-cool_ and **_super-secret_** project requiring much of our days and nights. We are, of course, very interested in the *open source ecosystem, especially **Large Language Models*** (**LLM**s) and the exponentially rapid advancements in all areas relating to A.I. and machine learning.
- 🤝 We are looking to collaborate on *Generative Artificial Intelligence* (**A.I.**) and *Machine Learning* (**M.L.**) applications.
- 💡 [**Cunning Folk Media**](http://cunningfolk.media), is currently accepting nonfiction and fiction manuscripts for publication. Do you have an [inquiry or submission](mailto:submissions@cunningfolk.media)? 
- 📨 [Email Us](mailto:contact@cunningfolk.media) or [call us anytime](tel:6174017810).
